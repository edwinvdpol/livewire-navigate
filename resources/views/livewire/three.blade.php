<div class="space-y-2">
    <h1>Page 3</h1>
    <p>Tadaa! The problem is that on the first page, the styles for nprogress are added.</p>
    <p>The injectStyles() should also respect the `inject_assets` configuration setting right?</p>
    <p>Click the link below, and keep going from page 1 to 3 etc. The stylesheet isn't loaded again until after a full refresh.</p>
    <p><a href="/" class="underline" wire:navigate>Goto page 1</a></p>
